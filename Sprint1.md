# First Assignment(Sprint_1) status

## GatorGiveaway

Generally, all the giveaways and sales of old stuff happen in WhatsApp groups. There are many groups, and it's very hard to keep track of those groups and posts. The idea is to provide a web-application for such sales and giveaway stuff. It's basically an eBay clone for UF.
